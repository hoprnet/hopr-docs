### Start the HOPRd node

1. Ensure that you have removed the old HOPR Docker container. You can find more details [here](node-operations.md#stop-your-hopr-node).

2. Ensure that your Docker command is properly configured. You can find the default Docker configuration details [here](node-docker.md#configure-hoprd-command). 

    If you're using a configuration file to manage your node strategies, refer to this [page](./manage-node-strategies.md#create-and-apply-configuration-file-to-your-node) and select **Docker**," then review **Step 6** for specific instructions.

3. Run your configured HOPR command by pasting it into the terminal.

### Stop the HOPRd node

To stop your current HOPR node, we will perform the HOPR Docker container removal procedure.

1. Connect to your machine and execute the command `docker ps`. This will provide you with a list of Docker containers you are currently running. Among them, locate the container with the label **europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/hoprassociation/docker-images/hoprd:stable** and note the **container ID**.

2. Remove the container using the following command: `docker rm -f <Your_Container_ID>`. Replace `<Your_Container_ID>` with your container ID.

    Example: 

    ```md
    docker rm -f 4951b2990936
    ```

### Start the HOPRd node

1. Go to your **compose** folder.

2. Use the profiles feature to start only the **hoprd** profile associated with the hopr node. 

    Run the following command: 
    
    ```
    COMPOSE_PROFILES=hoprd docker compose up -d
    ```

### Stop the HOPRd node

1. Go to your **compose** folder.

2. Use the profiles feature to stop only the **hoprd** profile associated with the hopr node. 

    Run the following command:

2. Start your HOPR node based on your current needs:

    - To resume an existing HOPR package, navigate to **Packages**, select the [HOPR package](http://my.dappnode/packages/my/hopr.public.dappnode.eth/info), and click the **Play** icon to activate it.
    - To set up a new HOPR package, please refer to this [guide](node-dappnode.md#install-the-hopr-package).

After installing the HOPRd package, the following directories and files are created:

| **Purpose**         | **Path**         | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Configuration files | `/etc/hoprd`     | Contains configuration files like `hoprd.cfg.yaml` and `hoprd.env` |
| Data directory      | `/var/lib/hoprd` | Stores the node’s database and runtime data                        |
| Log files           | `/var/log/hoprd` | Runtime logs generated by the node                                 |

The HOPRd package sets up a `systemd` service named `hoprd`, which you can manage using `systemctl`.

1. **Start the HOPRd node**

   Starts the node if it’s not already running:

   ```
   sudo systemctl start hoprd
   ```

2. **Stop the HOPRd node**

   Stops the running node:

   ```
   sudo systemctl stop hoprd
   ```

3. **Restart the HOPRd node**

   Stops and then restarts the node:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart hoprd
   ```

4. **Check the Node Status**

   Displays the current status, including whether it's active and recent log output:

   ```
   sudo systemctl status hoprd
   ```
