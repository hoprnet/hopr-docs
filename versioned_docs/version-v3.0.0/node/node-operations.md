### Start the HOPRd node

1. Ensure that you have removed the old HOPR Docker container. You can find more details [here](node-operations.md).

2. Ensure that your Docker command is properly configured. You can find the default Docker configuration details [here](node-docker.md#configure-hoprd-command). 

    If you're using a configuration file to manage your node strategies, refer to this [page](./manage-node-strategies.md#create-and-apply-configuration-file-to-your-node) and select **Docker**," then review **Step 6** for specific instructions.

3. Run your configured HOPR command by pasting it into the terminal.

### Stop the HOPRd node

To stop your current HOPR node, we will perform the HOPR Docker container removal procedure.

1. Connect to your machine and execute the command `docker ps`. This will provide you with a list of Docker containers you are currently running. Among them, locate the container with the label **europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/hoprassociation/docker-images/hoprd:stable** and note the **container ID**.

2. Remove the container using the following command: `docker rm -f <Your_Container_ID>`. Replace `<Your_Container_ID>` with your container ID.

    Example: 

    ```md
    docker rm -f 4951b2990936
    ```

After installing the HOPRd package, the following directories and files are created:

| **Purpose**         | **Path**         | **Description**                                                    |
