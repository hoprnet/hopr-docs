## Sample Queries

Below are some sample queries you can use to gather information from the Stake Season6 subgraph.

You can build your own queries using a [GraphQL Explorer](https://graphiql-online.com/graphiql) and enter your endpoint to limit the data to exactly what you need.

Each entity has a plural version and a singular version. When querying for a single record response (e.g. account), you will need to supply the id for the entity. When querying for a list of responses (e.g. accounts), you may add filters using the 'where' clause.

### Staked balance

Description: This query returns balances for available rewards, total claimed and unclaimed for staked tokens.

```graphql
{
  programs {
    availableReward
    totalClaimedRewards
    totalUnclaimedRewards
  }
}
```

### Account BoostRate

Description: This query, in descending order returns the first 10 accounts with a boost rate greater than 3000.

```graphql
{
  accounts(
    where: { boostRate_gte: "3000" }
    first: 10
    orderBy: id
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    id
    claimedRewards
    boostRate
  }
}
```
