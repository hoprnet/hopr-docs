title: How to Unstake HOPR SS08 
---

Staking Season 8 has ended, and it was the last of the staking seasons. HOPR can now only be staked in association with a running HOPR node through HOPR SafeStaking. Please unstake and claim all of your rewards, NFTs and tokens from the Staking Season 8 smart contract, and if you would like, you can [restake them within a HOPR Safe and run a HOPR node.](../node/start-here.md)

## Unstaking HOPR Tokens & Claiming Rewards

To unstake your tokens and claim your rewards:

(**1**) Press the button labelled `Claim All Rewards & NFTs` under your `Staked xHOPR` display.

(**2**) The tokens will have arrived in your wallet as `wxHOPR`. Use [our wrapper](https://wrapper.hoprnet.org/) to convert them to your preferred tokens.

(**Optional**) Follow the instructions [here](../node/start-here.md) to restake your tokens in a HOPR Safe and run a node.
