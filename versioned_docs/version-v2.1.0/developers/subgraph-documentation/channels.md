## Sample Queries

Below are some sample queries you can use to gather information from the HOPR Channel subgraph.

You can build your own queries using a [GraphQL Explorer](https://graphiql-online.com/graphiql) and enter your endpoint to limit the data to exactly what you need.

Each entity has a plural version and a singular version. When querying for a single record response (e.g. account), you will need to supply the id for the entity. When querying for a list of responses (e.g. accounts), you may add filters using the 'where' clause.

### Channels

Description: This query returns the channel status and epoch where redeemed ticket count is greater than 1.

```graphql
{
  channels(where: { redeemedTicketCount_gte: "1" }) {
    id
    channelEpoch
    redeemedTicketCount
    status
  }
}
```

### Snapshot

Description: This query returns the snapshot of channels that have a 'closed' status.

```graphql
{
  statusSnapshots(where: { status: CLOSED }) {
    id
    status
    timestamp
    channel {
      balance
      tickets {
        amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
