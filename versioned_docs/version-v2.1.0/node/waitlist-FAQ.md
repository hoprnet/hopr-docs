### What is the waitlist?

To allow for the controlled scaling of the initial Dufour release, we have implemented a HOPR network waitlist. After having created a HOPR Safe and HOPR Node, you will need to register to the waitlist using the [waitlist form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/7TwSgsF+CnW-aw24uyPlE4Gej3DX-jjeYmyk9-Q-6RQ). 

After you have been approved to join the network, you can return to the [Staking Hub](https://hub.hoprnet.org/) to complete your onboarding and join the network.

### How do I join the waitlist?

To join the waitlist, first, you have to create a HOPR Safe and HOPR Node. Then register your Node and Safe using the [waitlist form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/7TwSgsF+CnW-aw24uyPlE4Gej3DX-jjeYmyk9-Q-6RQ). 

You can create a Safe and node using the onboarding wizard in the [Staking Hub](https://hub.hoprnet.org/).

### What is the Network Registry NFT?

Node runners from our previous release (Monte Rosa) were given an NFT to register within the network. This NFT is kept active for the Dufour release to allow previous node runners to join the network earlier and with a lower stake.

### What is the minimum stake required to participate in the Dufour release?

- **Without a Network Registry NFT:** You will need a minimum of 30,000 wxHOPR and at least one xDAI.
- **With a Network Registry NFT:** You will need a minimum of 10,000 wxHOPR and at least one xDAI.

You can find where to purchase the relevant tokens [here](../staking/how-to-get-hopr.md).

### I have registered on the waitlist, but I can't find my address

The waitlist is currently updated manually, so if you have completed the [waitlist form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/7TwSgsF+CnW-aw24uyPlE4Gej3DX-jjeYmyk9-Q-6RQ) with accurate information, you should see your address soon. 

**Note:** Applications that have removed their staked wxHOPR will also be periodically removed from the waitlist. Please make sure you have not dropped below the minimum required stake if you have withdrawn funds from the safe recently.

### How is the waitlist generated?

First, we give priority to applicants who have Network Registry NFTs, ordering them by the time of application registration. The remaining applicants who don't have Network Registry NFTs are ordered by their stake size.

The applicants list is manually collected every Friday at 8 AM CEST, and the waitlist sheet is manually updated later on the same day. This means that if you fill out the waitlist form after 8 AM CEST, you will need to wait until the following Wednesday.

### How are new slots distributed?

New slots are distributed on a tri-weekly basis, every Wednesday.

### Why did my position change after the waitlist was updated?

Your position may change if you don't have Network Registry NFT and new applicants joined with a higher stake and others may have withdrawn funds or been off-boarded due to a lack of funds.
