RPCh is the only private, secure, and decentralized gateway to the blockchain, offering the first true protection against data harvesting by RPC providers. The RPCh app is built on top of the HOPR protocol, ensuring enhanced privacy and security for blockchain interactions.

## What problem RPCh solves?

Crypto wallets are an essential part of the blockchain ecosystem. But wallet transactions rely on RPC providers, centralized companies who can view and store users’ data and metadata, well beyond what’s available on chain.

Even if your provider is trustworthy, handling vital metadata and sensitive information in this way poses a significant risk to privacy and security. RPCh plugs this leak by routing requests and responses through the HOPR mixnet, completely obscuring your metadata to all observers, including your provider.
