RPCh is the only private, secure, and decentralized gateway to the blockchain, offering the first true protection against data harvesting by RPC providers. The RPCh app is built on top of the HOPR protocol, ensuring enhanced privacy and security for blockchain interactions.

## What problem does RPCh solve?

Crypto wallets are an essential part of the blockchain ecosystem, but wallet transactions rely on RPC providers, centralized companies that can view and store users’ data and metadata, well beyond what’s available on-chain.

Even if your provider is trustworthy, handling vital metadata and sensitive information in this way poses a significant risk to privacy and security. RPCh addresses this issue by routing requests and responses through the HOPR mixnet, completely obscuring your metadata from all observers, including your provider.
