The HOPR token can be bridged between the **Ethereum** and **Gnosis** chains. Please choose the direction of the bridge:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="htoxh" label="Bridge HOPR (Ethereum) to xHOPR (Gnosis)">

#### 1. Navigate to the bridge
   
   Go to the [Gnosis Bridge page](https://bridge.gnosischain.com).

#### 2. Connect your wallet
   
   In the top-right corner, click "**Connect Wallet**" to link your wallet with the Gnosis Bridge.

#### 3. Select Ethereum chain & token
   
   In the "**Transfer from**" section, ensure that "**Ethereum**" is selected as the chain. Then, click on "**Select token**" and search for "**HOPR token**". In the input field, enter the amount of HOPR tokens you want to bridge to Gnosis.
   
   :::warning important

    If you are using a [Safe wallet](https://safe.global), you must use a different recipient address. Safe wallets are smart contracts built on specific blockchains, and they cannot be used across multiple chains. To avoid losing your funds, ensure the recipient address **supports the Gnosis chain**.

    To use a different recipient address, click "**Send to a different wallet**" and enter an address that is compatible with the Gnosis chain.
