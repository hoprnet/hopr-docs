HOPRd nodes play a crucial role in our decentralized network, operated by members of the HOPR community. Before setting up your own HOPRd node, we strongly recommend reviewing this overview page, which outlines all the necessary details and requirements.

Please note that the HOPR network is currently permissioned, requiring you to complete an onboarding process to gain access and participate with your node. As part of this process, you'll need to submit a waitlist form. Access is granted on a **tri-weekly** basis. Be sure to review the requirements below before proceeding with the onboarding process.

### Requirements to participate in the HOPR network

To operate your node in the HOPR network, you must stake HOPR tokens. The minimum stake required is **30,000 wxHOPR**. However, if you participated in the testnets and possess a **Network Registry NFT**, your minimum stake requirement is reduced to **10,000 wxHOPR**. 

### Node system requirements

The minimum requirements for running **hoprd** on your device:

- Dual-Core CPU or 2vCPU
- 2GB of RAM
- at least 5GB of disk space
