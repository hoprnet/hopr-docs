Node strategies allow for much more detailed and granular control over your node's behavior and its interaction with the protocol, making this feature primarily suited for advanced users. These strategies enable you to effectively manage your node by configuring settings such as the threshold for ticket aggregation, the redemption process, and more. To modify or manage these strategies, you will need to implement a configuration file.

## Create and apply configuration file to your node

Please select your platform:

<Tabs queryString="config">
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

(**1**) Download the example file specificaly for Docker: [hoprd-docker.cfg.yaml](pathname:///files/hoprd-docker.cfg.yaml)

(**2**) By default, the strategy settings file is pre-configured and works well as is. However, if you have a clear understanding of the settings and their implications, you can customize them to better align with your specific needs. For detailed instructions, please refer to the section: [Understanding Node Strategies](./manage-node-strategies.md#understanding-node-strategies).

(**3**) Navigate to the "**.hopr-id-dufour**" directory on your machine and upload the newly created configuration file there. Ensure that the configuration file is named "**hoprd-docker.cfg.yaml**".

(**4**) After uploading the configuration file, [stop your current node](./node-operations.md#stop-your-hopr-node).

(**5**) Once your node is stopped, add the additional parameter "**--configurationFilePath '/app/hoprd-db/hoprd-docker.cfg.yaml'**" to link your configuration file to your current docker command.

Docker command: 

```md
docker run --pull always -d --restart on-failure -m 2g --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --platform linux/x86_64 --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=100M --log-opt max-file=5 -ti -v $HOME/.hoprd-db-dufour:/app/hoprd-db --name hoprd -p 9091:9091/tcp -p 9091:9091/udp -p 3001:3001 -e RUST_LOG=info europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/hoprassociation/docker-images/hoprd:stable --network dufour --init --api --announce --identity /app/hoprd-db/.hopr-id-dufour --data /app/hoprd-db --apiHost '0.0.0.0' --apiToken '<SECRET_TOKEN>' --password 'open-sesame-iTwnsPNg0hpagP+o6T0KOwiH9RQ0' --safeAddress <SAFE_WALLET_ADDRESS> --moduleAddress <MODULE_ADDRESS> --host <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>:9091 --provider <CUSTOM_RPC_PROVIDER> --configurationFilePath '/app/hoprd-db/hoprd-docker.cfg.yaml'
```

**Note:** If you're running multiple nodes or have changed the default ports, make the necessary port adjustments accordingly.

(**7**) Paste your Docker command into the terminal window and execute it.

(**8**) Wait for about 5 minutes, then [connect to your node](./node-management-admin-ui#connecting-your-node) via the HOPR Admin UI. Navigate to the "**CONFIGURATION**" page to verify that the strategy settings have been updated. If the changes aren't visible, try performing a hard refresh of the HOPR Admin UI page.
 
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker compose">

Inside the "**compose**" folder, navigate to the "**hoprd_data**" folder and make the necessary edits to the "**hoprd.cfg.yaml**" file:

- **address**: 

    - Locate your external IP address by refering to our [FAQ here](./frequently-asked-questions.md#how-to-find-the-external-ip-address). 

    - Refer to the [FAQ guide](./frequently-asked-questions#what-are-the-requirements-for-an-ip-address-to-run-a-hoprd-node) to determine if your IP address meets the requirements.
    
    - Replace **127.0.0.1** with your own public IP address when configuring your node.

- **port**: 

    - The default port for peer-to-peer communication is **9091**.

    - If youâ€™ve set a different port using the `HOPRD_P2P_PORT` environment variable, make sure to use that one instead.

    - If you plan to run HOPRd node(s) behind NAT (Network Address Translation), such as on computers or servers at home or in an office environment, you must expose port `9091` to the public so that other nodes on the HOPR network can connect to your node. For instructions, see our [port forwarding guide](port-forwarding.md#how-to-configure-port-forwarding).

- **provider**: Use your own RPC provider, more details about [custom RPC provider](./custom-rpc-provider.md#1-run-your-own-gnosis-chain-node-most-secure-and-reliable). If you're using a local RPC endpoint, ensure the URL includes the "**http://**" prefix followed by the IP address or localhost.
- **safe_address**: Add your Safe wallet address, more details under [safe_module](./manage-node-strategies.md#hoprsafe_module).
- **module_address**: Add your Module address, more details under [safe_module](./manage-node-strategies.md#hoprsafe_module).

**Note:** By default, the strategy settings file is pre-configured and works well as is. However, if you have a clear understanding of the settings and their implications, you can customize them to better align with your specific needs. For detailed instructions, please refer to the section: [Understanding Node Strategies](./manage-node-strategies.md#understanding-node-strategies).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dappnode" label="Dappnode">

(**1**) Download the example file specifically for the Dappnode: [hoprd.cfg.yaml](pathname:///files/hoprd.cfg.yaml)

(**2**) By default, the strategy settings file is pre-configured and works well as is. However, if you have a clear understanding of the settings and their implications, you can customize them to better align with your specific needs. For detailed instructions, please refer to the section: [Understanding Node Strategies](./manage-node-strategies.md#understanding-node-strategies).

**Note:** Adjust the [strategies section](./manage-node-strategies.md#hoprstrategy) according to your needs; no other configuration is required.

(**3**) After adjusting the configuration file, connect to your Dappnode dashboard, locate the "**HOPR**" package, and navigate to the "**File Manager**" tab.

![File Manager](/img/node/dappnode-file-manager.png)

(**4**) In the "**Upload file**" section, click the "**Browse**" button next to the "**Choose file**" field, then select your newly created configuration file. Ensure that the configuration file is named "**hoprd.cfg.yaml**".

(**5**) In the text field under the "**Upload file**" section, enter the path `/app/`.

![Dappnode file upload path](/img/node/dappnode-prefilled-config-data.png)

(**6**) Click the "**Upload**" button and wait for the upload to finish.

(**7**) Go to the "**Info**" page within your HOPR package, and click the "**Restart**" button to restart your node.

(**8**) Wait for about 5 minutes, then [connect to your node](./node-management-admin-ui#connecting-your-node) via the HOPR Admin UI. Navigate to the "**CONFIGURATION**" page to verify that the strategy settings have been updated. If the changes aren't visible, try performing a hard refresh of the HOPR Admin UI page.

:::info

HOPR token amounts are measured with **18 decimal places**. When setting a custom value, be sure to **add 18 zeros to the integer value**. For example, **1 HOPR Token** should be entered as **1000000000000000000 HOPR**.

:::

#### strategy.on_fail_continue

When set to "**true**", the system will continue executing subsequent strategies even if previous ones fail.

#### strategy.allow_recursive

Allows nesting strategies through **!MultiStrategy**.

---

#### strategy.strategies

Contains a sequence of strategies to execute in the specified order. If left empty, the node will default to using only the "**!Passive**" strategy.

##### strategy.strategies: !Promiscuous

Defines a promiscuous strategy that automatically manages HOPR channels based on certain measured qualities of other HOPR nodes in the network.

| Settings | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `max_channels` | The maximum number of opened channels the strategy should maintain. |
