## Sample Queries

Below are some sample queries you can use to gather information from the HOPR Token (Gnosis) subgraph.

You can build your own queries using a [GraphQL Explorer](https://graphiql-online.com/graphiql) and enter your endpoint to limit the data to exactly what you need.

Each entity has a plural version and a singular version. When querying for a single record response (e.g. account), you will need to supply the id for the entity. When querying for a list of responses (e.g. accounts), you may add filters using the 'where' clause.

### Token Balance

Description: This query returns accounts that have both xhopr and wxhopr tokens and their corresponding amounts.

```graphql
{
  accounts(where: { wxHoprBalance_gte: "1", xHoprBalance_gte: "1" }) {
    id
    wxHoprBalance
    xHoprBalance
    totalBalance
  }
}
```

### XHOPR Token

Description: This query returns the first 10 accounts that have XHOPR tokens after a certain block number.

```graphql
{
  accounts(
    where: {xHoprBalance_gte: "1", blockNumber_gte: "24743804"}
    first: 10
    orderBy: id
    orderDirection: asc
  ) {
    id
    xHoprBalance
    totalBalance
    blockNumber
  }
}
```
