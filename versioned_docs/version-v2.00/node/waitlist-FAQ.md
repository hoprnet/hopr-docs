### What is the waitlist?

To allow for the controlled scalling of the initial Dufour release, we have implemented a HOPR network waitlist. After having created a HOPR Safe and HOPR Node, you will need to register to the waitlist using the [waitlist form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/K3KSF-UAM-mLjUCs4w3Cruu4wZeOdwQFLNG1aYqrjbg/). 

After you have been approved to join the network, you can return to the [Staking Hub](https://hub.hoprnet.org/) to complete your onboarding and join the network.

### How do I join the waitlist?

To join the waitlist, first you have to create a HOPR Safe and HOPR Node. Then register your Node and Safe using the [waitlist form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/K3KSF-UAM-mLjUCs4w3Cruu4wZeOdwQFLNG1aYqrjbg/). 

You can create safe and node using the onboarding wizard in the [Staking Hub](https://hub.hoprnet.org/).

### What is the minimum stake required to participate in the Dufour release?

- **Without a Network Registry NFT:** You will need a minimum of 30,000 wxHOPR and atleast one xDAI.
- **With a Network Registry NFT:** You will need a minimum of 10,000 wxHOPR and atleast one xDAI.

You can find where to purchase the relevant tokens [here](../). 

### How often is the waitlist updated?

The waitlist is updated on a monthly basis.

### I have registered on the waitlist, but I can't find my address

There could be two explanations:

- You arenâ€™t staking the minimum amount (1000 HOPR tokens for Avado / Dappnode users, or 2000 HOPR tokens for everyone else).
- The waitlist hasn't been updated yet, and your staking address will be included in the next update.

### How is the waitlist generated?

Every eligible staking address is ranked according to the number and rank of HOPR boost NFTs staked. Addresses receive points based on the rank of their NFT (1 for bronze, 2 for silver, 3 for gold and 4 for diamond). If addresses have the same NFT score, ties are broken by staking amount.

Avado and Dappnode owners have waitlist priority, but the waitlist is used to break ties between Avado and Dappnode owners.

### How are new slots distributed?

New slots are distributed based on the following ratio:

- 60% - users based purely on waitlist position (Avado and Dappnode users will be also included here if they organically have a high rank)
- 20% - Avado users
- 20% - Dappnode users

### Why did my position change after the waitlist was updated?

New registrants will be added to the waitlist based on their NFT score and stake. This means that your position could drop.
