# How to Use The RPCh Integrated Frame Wallet

This is a guide on how to use the RPCh-integrated version of the Frame Wallet. The guide goes through using Frame on Chrome, but a similar set of instructions can be followed for any alternative browser.

## Step 1: Download Integrated Frame Wallet

(**1**) Download the correct distribution of the Frame wallet depending on your OS:

* MacOS
* Windows
* Linux

**Note:** If using macOS, extract the folder somewhere convenient.

Please find the distribution here for testing as not hosted on GH right now: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ZYsMVuuDRsIBw0OqN9H9wo9uoVGeUuK

(**2**) You should now have an application icon you can click on to install Frame. This will look similar to the below image on macOS.

## Step 2: Import Wallet to Frame

Frame does not allow you to create wallets, only import existing ones. The following example shows how to import your MetaMask Wallet to Frame. 

(**1**) On MetaMask, navigate to `Settings`.

(**3**) Press the `Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase` Button and complete the security questions.

(**4**) With your Secret Recovery Phrase copied, open the Frame wallet application.

(**5**) Press the Menu button on the top left of the application.

(**6**) In the new menu, select `Accounts` and then at the bottom of the screen, press the `Add New Account ` button.

(**7**) Select the `Seed Phrase` option, then paste your recovery phase in the text box once prompted.

(**8**) Create a new password for your wallet and select the address you want to import.

## Step 3: Download Frame Companion 

To use Frame on your browser, you need to use the Frame Companion extension.

(**1**) Download the Frame Companion extension to your browser, here is the [link for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/frame-companion/ldcoohedfbjoobcadoglnnmmfbdlmmhf)

## Using Frame With Dapps

To Use Frame with Dapps, you need to make sure:

* You have the Frame Companion extension installed on your browser
* No clashing wallets are enabled, e.g. MetaMask 
* You have imported a useable wallet to Frame

(**1**) Disable any clashing wallets, such as MetaMask, in the extensions section of your browser.

(**2**) Make sure you have your Frame Wallet application open with at least one wallet imported.

(**3**) Once you are on the Dapp you want to use, click on the Frame Companion Extension in your browser and on the pop-up, select `APPEAR AS METAMASK INSTEAD`.

**Note:** You will have to do this every time you use a new Dapp.

(**4**) When connecting your wallet to a Dapp, select the MetaMask option, and your imported Frame wallet should connect by default.
